## About

* I chose to mine about dogs!
* Full size site is for full wide screen. Boxes take up 33% each.
* Switch to Mid-size at 900 px wide for narrow desktop viewing.  Only big difference is that the photo drops to the bottom and now the left
sections takes up the whole screen.
* Mobile is at 583 px wide.  Header box is 100% and boxes are now 50% of the page.  Small border is added to differentiate between same color boxes.
